## SYNOPSIS

 service omxd start|stop|restart
 omxd [-d]

 echo <command> [abs-path] > /var/run/omxctl
 omxd <command> [rel-path]

After install, omxd is started automatically at boot.

## OPTIONS

 -h	Print this help text
 -d	Start daemon with debug logging enabled
 -n	No fork, run in foreground, log to stderr

## COMMANDS

omxd listens for commands through the /var/run/omxctl FIFO,
please write one command at a time into it, for example:

echo A /home/foo/bar.mp3 > /var/run/omxctl

## CLIENT MODE

You can call omxd with the above commands as arguments, it writes them
into /var/run/omxctl, but translates relative paths into absolute ones
and performs commands recursively if you specify a directory as the file.

## FILES

When you start 'omxd -d' as an unprivileged user the files below
will be created in the current directory instead of the locations below,
to allow easier testing.

     /var/run/omxctl	FIFO to write commands into
     /var/local/omxplay	playlist file, actual item indicated by >
     /var/log/omxlog	log file
     /var/log/omxstat	status log file
     /var/log/omxplayer.log.<pid>
     /etc/omxd/omxd.conf defines user to run omxplayer: user=foo
     /etc/init.d/omxd	init script
